# Browser Extension Entry Points

Browser extensions have multiple entry points for different contexts. Here's how TabTime is structured:

## Background Script

[background.ts](mdc:entrypoints/background.ts) - The main background script that:
- Tracks active tab time
- Records usage statistics
- Manages website time limits
- Handles blocking when limits are reached

This script runs continuously in the background while the browser is open, even when the extension UI is not visible.

## Options Page

The options page provides a full dashboard experience:
- [options/index.html](mdc:entrypoints/options/index.html) - HTML entry point
- [options/main.tsx](mdc:entrypoints/options/main.tsx) - React bootstrapping
- [options/App.tsx](mdc:entrypoints/options/App.tsx) - Main component with dashboard UI

The options page is accessed by right-clicking the extension icon and selecting "Options" or through the browser's extension management page.

## Sidepanel

The sidepanel provides quick access to stats without leaving the current page:
- [sidepanel/index.html](mdc:entrypoints/sidepanel/index.html) - HTML entry point
- [sidepanel/main.tsx](mdc:entrypoints/sidepanel/main.tsx) - React bootstrapping
- [sidepanel/App.tsx](mdc:entrypoints/sidepanel/App.tsx) - Main component with simplified UI

The sidepanel is accessed by clicking the extension icon in the browser toolbar.

## Content Script

[content.ts](mdc:entrypoints/content.ts) - A minimal content script that runs in the context of web pages to provide additional functionality if needed.
